                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>On a smooth, clean work surface, place flour in a mound. Create a well in the center of the flour large enough for the wet ingredients (the well should be wider than it is tall with enough flour at the edges to support the wet ingredients when mixing). Add the olive oil and salt and crack the eggs into the well. Using a fork, start beating the egg mixture slowly, gradually incorporating the flour from the inside, being careful not to break the well. Once the egg mixture is thickened and a pale yellow color, break the well and begin mixing in all of the flour.</li>
                    <li>Using a bench scraper or floured hands, scoop and fold the mixture together until a dough forms. Knead dough by hand until smooth and the dough springs back when poked, about 10 to 15 minutes. (it will start out pretty stiff and soften as you knead.) Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, stir together the cheeses, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a piping and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
                    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with semolina flour. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Remove one piece of dough and press it into a rectangle, about ¼ inch thick. Sprinkle with semolina flour.</li>
                    <li> With the pasta rollers on their widest setting (#1 on a KitchenAid), pass the dough through the pasta machine. Fold the dough in half, and pass through again. Repeat this process once more. Pass the dough through the widest setting 2 more times without folding, making sure the dough is the width of the rollers. Adjust the rollers to the next widest setting (#2 on a KitchenAid). Sprinkle dough with semolina flour and pass through the roller twice. Adjust rollers to the next widest setting, and pass the dough through twice. Continue this process until the rollers are in their thinnest setting (#8 on a KitchenAid).</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the pasta sheet with semolina flour and gently fold to fit the prepared sheet tray. Cover with a tea towel to keep it from drying out. Repeat this process with the remaining 3 pieces of dough</li>
                    <li>On a clean work surface, lay 1 pasta sheet lengthwise. Place another pasta sheet directly above the first so they are parallel to each other. Trim any uneven edges so the sheets are the same size. Brush any excess semolina flour off both sheets. On the first pasta sheet, pipe 2 rows of filling into roughly 1½-teaspoon-mounds about 1½ inches apart, leaving at least a ½-inch border on the edges of the pasta sheet.</li>
                    <li>Brush the second pasta sheet lightly with water. Immediately place the second sheet, watered-side-down, on top of the first sheet. Carefully press to seal around each mound of filling, making sure to push out as much air as possible. (Air bubbles can cause the ravioli to break when boiled.)</li>
                    <li>Using a pastry cutter or knife, carefully trim the outside edges of the pasta sheet to create clean, even sides. Next, cut lengthwise between the two rows of filling. Finally, cut vertically to separate into individual ravioli. Place on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with semolina flour. Repeat the assembly with the remaining sheets of pasta. Allow the ravioli to rest uncovered in a single layer and dry slightly before boiling, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt heavily. Reduce the heat to medium. Working in two batches, carefully drop the ravioli into the gently boiling water. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. Remove the cheese ravioli from the water with a slotted spoon and immediately place them in the desired sauce. Serve immediately, with your favorite sauce and a garnish of fresh basil.</li>
